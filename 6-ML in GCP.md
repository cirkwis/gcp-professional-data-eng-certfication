## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- Machine learning is a way to use standard algorithms to derive predictive insights from data and make repeated decisions.
- backward-looking use of data - looking at historical data to create reports and dashboards
- Question about automating: 
  - make decision for every production in every region?
  - dynamically adjust the price? 
  - make decisions around predictive insights repeatable
- ML is about scaling up BI and decision making
