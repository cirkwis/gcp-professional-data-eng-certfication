## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- Machine learning is a way to use standard algorithms to derive predictive insights from data and make repeated decisions.
- backward-looking use of data - looking at historical data to create reports and dashboards
- Question about automating: 
  - make decision for every production in every region?
  - dynamically adjust the price? 
  - make decisions around predictive insights repeatable
- ML is about scaling up BI and decision making

## Stage 1: Train an ML model with examples
- The first stage of ML is to train an ML model with examples. 
- In this section, we focus on supervised learning which starts from examples. 
- An example consists of an input and a label (the true answer of this input). 

## Features Engineering: Good features
- Good features bring human insight to problem
- Options for encoding categorical data. These are all different ways to create a SPARSE-column
- Crossing features can simplify learning: crossing two or more feature to make a new feature. 
## Features Engineering: Causuality
- Feature value known at the time prediction is made? 
- Causal: can not realy on future information
- Must ingest that data in timely manner
- Legal/ethical to collect use that information
## Features Engineering: Numeric with meaningful magnitude
- Non-numeric features can be used, it's just that we need to find a way to represent them in numeric form
## Features Engineering: Enough example

## Features Engineering: Bucketizing 
The transformation of numeric features into categorical features, using a set of thresholds, is called bucketing (or binning)
